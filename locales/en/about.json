  "bio_text": "Hello, my name is Mika (Mee-kuh) and I am an animation and film graduate of UCLA (University of California, Los Angeles) School of Theatre, Film, and Television. Prior to UCLA I was an English Composition and Film/Screenwriting major at El Camino Community College.<br /><br />My background focuses heavily on storytelling and communicating my thoughts in the best way possible. My love for storytelling shaped my childhood where I would illustrate children's stories, write poems, play with puppets, and create shows. I believe in entertainment as a form of escape, but find it imperative to return back to reality and better the world we live in. I am passionate about environmental conservation, minority representation in media, and spreading positive and emotional messages to a broad range of audiences. More than anything, I love creating content that inspires people to set aside their differences and connect with each other.",
